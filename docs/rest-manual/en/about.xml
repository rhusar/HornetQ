    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>HornetQ is an open source project to build a multi-protocol, embeddable, very high
                performance, clustered, asynchronous messaging system.</para>

        <listitem>
            <para>For answers to more questions about what HornetQ is and what it isn't please visit

    <para>Why use HornetQ? Here are just a few of the reasons:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>100% open source software. HornetQ is licenced using the Apache Software License v2.0
                to minimise barriers to adoption.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>HornetQ is designed with usability in mind.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Written in Java. Runs on any platform with a Java 6+ runtime, that's everything
                from Windows desktops to IBM mainframes.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Amazing performance. Our class beating high performance journal provides persistent
                messaging performance at rates normally seen for non persistent messaging, our non
                persistent messaging performance rocks the boat too.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Full feature set. All the features you'd expect in any serious messaging system,
                and others you won't find anywhere else.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Elegant, clean-cut design with minimal third party dependencies. Run HornetQ
                stand-alone, run it in integrated in your favourite JEE application server, or run
                it embedded inside your own product. It's up to you.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Seamless high availability. We provide a HA solution with automatic client
                failover so you can guarantee zero message loss or duplication in event of server
                failure.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Hugely flexible clustering. Create clusters of servers that know how to load
                balance messages. Link geographically distributed clusters over unreliable
                connections to form a global network. Configure routing of messages in a highly
                flexible way.</para>
        </listitem>
