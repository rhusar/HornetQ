  <title>Creating Destinations</title>

  <para>You can create a durable queue or topic through the REST interface.
  Currently you cannot create a temporary queue or topic. To create a queue
  you do a POST to the relative URL /queues with an XML representation of
  the queue. The XML syntax is the same queue syntax that you would specify
  in hornetq-jms.xml if you were creating a queue there. For example:</para>

  <programlisting>POST /queues
 Host: example.com
 Content-Type: application/hornetq.jms.queue+xml

 &lt;queue name="testQueue"&gt;
 &lt;durable&gt;true&lt;/durable&gt;
 &lt;/queue&gt;

 --- Response ---
 HTTP/1.1 201 Created
 Location: http://example.com/queues/jms.queue.testQueue
 </programlisting>

  <para>Notice that the Content-Type is
  application/hornetq.jms.queue+xml.</para>

  <para>Here's what creating a topic would look like:</para>

  <programlisting>POST /topics
 Host: example.com
 Content-Type: application/hornetq.jms.topic+xml

 &lt;topic name="testTopic"&gt;
 &lt;/topic&gt;

 --- Response ---
 HTTP/1.1 201 Created
 Location: http://example.com/topics/jms.topic.testTopic</programlisting>
