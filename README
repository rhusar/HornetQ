This file describes 'stuff one needs to know' to get started coding in
this project.

* Maven:

You need Maven 3.X.

Do note that there are some compatibility issues with Maven 3.X still
unsolved [1].  This is specially true for the 'site' plugin [2].

* TESTS:

To run the unittests

% mvn -Phudson-tests tests

** Generating reports from unit tests

% mvn install
% mvn site # (this currently does not work)

* To build a release artifact

% mvn install -Prelease

* Eclipse

** Use the Maven eclipse plugin to configure the sub-projects

$ mvn eclipse:eclipse

** Install the m2Eclipse plugin, and use it to import the root
   project. Each sub-project will be imported automatically.

The M2Eclipse plugin only works correctly with javacc Maven rules in
Eclipse 3.7. In Eclipse 3.6 after importing the projects you should use
"Maven / Update project configuration" to fix up the projects.
